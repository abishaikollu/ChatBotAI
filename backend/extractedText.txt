Assignment-01:  Custom AI Chatbot Using LLM
10% weightage, Deadline 27 Nov 2023
1  Introduction
In this assignment we will develop a custom conversational AI agent (Chatbot) using openAI
APIs.   You  know  such  systems  can  provide  replies  to  user’s  queries.   By  custom  we  mean
that the answers will be based on domain specific knowledge provided to the AI agent using
a PDF. In this assignment, we will only focus on text-based conversations.  This assignment
has four parts.
1.  Develop  a  webapp,  allowing  user  to  chat  with  the  AI  agent  by  providing  a  place  to
enter his query and see the responses obtained by the system.  This is similar to any
instant messaging system where our responses are coming from the AI agent.  To test
the functionality of this step the Chatbot can generate random responses.
[Marks 1%]
2.  Extend the webapp developed above to integrate openAI. Now the Chatbot will gener-
ate the responses using openAI API’s similar to ChatGPT. You can get details of using
openAI  API’s  fromhttps://community.openai.com/.   You  may  have  to  create  an
account in openAI for this step.  You can look on a short course on youtube “Building
Systems with the ChatGPT API: A short course from OpenAI and DeepLearning.AI”

.
Also you can do a google search “How to Build an AI-Powered ChatBot with OpenAI,
ChatGPT, Node.js, and React” and see the material available online

.

3.  Further extend the above Chatbot by customising it to generate responses confined to
a domain specific knowledge gathered by supplying a PDF to the system.  You have
to use embedding model API’s of OpenAI to generate the embedding of a given PDF
and  use  it  as  a  database  for  providing  domain  specific  responses.   Search  on  google
“Customizing an OpenAI Chatbot With Embeddings” and visit page

4.  Integrate the uploading of PDF, generating embedding, and the AI agent into a sin-
gle  web  application.   The  GUI  of  the  app  should  allow  users  to  browse  and  upload
multiple PDFsand set the context for the conversation.  Now the Chatbot should
answer based on the supplied PDFs.
